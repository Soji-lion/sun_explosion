A simple multiplayer game about maintaining a fragile balance.
Current features:

	- working multiplayer
	- sun changes color based on its "temperature" (or remaining time until explosion, functionally, both are the same
	- the sun can explode into supernova (unpolished)
	- the sun can freeze down (when exceeding 1 million "seconds until explosion"), unfinished

TODO:

	- finish supernova animation
	- make sun "freeze" animation
	- add chat feature
	- polish transition between sun states
	- other visual and functional improvements?
